# GameApp

This is a slot machine game, written in Swift + SwiftUI.

The goal of the game is to win as much money as possible. It follows the simple layout of a 3x slot machine - to win money, you must get all 3 tokens in a row.

The game incorporates many different built-in Swift Features, such as User Defaults, Haptic Inputs, Sound Packages + Display Animations. Each spin creates an animation effect; a user's high score is saved into local storage (using User Defaults), and there are haptic + sound inputs for each successul + non-successful spin. Animations are also applied when the user changes their betting quantity. 

The overall purpose of this project was to further my UI Design and Swift Development skills. 


This is the game in action:
